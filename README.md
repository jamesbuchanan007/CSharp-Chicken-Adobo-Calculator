# CSharp-Chicken-Adobo-Calculator
I hated it when I was at the store and was buying chicken but did not know (or remember) what I needed to make chicken adobo.

Enter weight of the store-bought chicken in pounds (#.##) and press Calculate.
Program will display how much sweet onion, garlic cloves, soy sauce, and vinegar you will need to make chicken adobo.
